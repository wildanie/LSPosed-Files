Custom LSPosed by [TheHitMan7](https://github.com/TheHitMan7) for Custom Magisk. Always synced with official changes but without DenyList implementation which is a part of Zygisk.
Custom Magisk does not contain DenyList but MagiskHide. Both `RIRU` and `ZYGISK` based builds are compatible with Custom Magisk.

## Installation

* Install Custom [Magisk](https://github.com/TheHitMan7/Magisk-Files)

> **Select either riru or zygisk based LSPosed Framework.**

## Riru

Riru and its modules are compatible with Zygisk.

## Conflict

Completely uninstall official LSPosed Framework before installing custom LSPosed Framework. Switching between custom LSPosed Framework does not require full uninstall.
Simply install over already installed custom LSPosed Framework.
